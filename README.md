# Monkey_Species_Image_Classification
A Convolutional Neural Network Approach to Classifying Images of Monkeys by Species 
This approach relied on a pre-trained model, which was kept as is in a first attempt and later fine tuned. In addition, using a threshold ReLU function as an activation function, with a theta vaue of .1 or .5, proved to be the most accurate model.
